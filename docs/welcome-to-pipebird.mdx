## Welcome to Pipebird

Pipebird is **open source infrastructure for deploying customer-facing data
pipelines**. Pipebird requires minimal engineering effort to begin offering
customers secure data pushes to their warehouses, directly from your product.

With Pipebird you can:

- select sources to push data from (such as PostgreSQL).
- let customers configure pipelines and apply transformations (such as type
  casting).
- periodically sync data directly to customers' warehouses (such as Snowflake).

Pipebird is for companies that want to share data directly, securely, and cost
efficiently.

- **Minimize security and compliance risks** created by involving third-party
  ETL providers. Pipebird enables direct data sharing from your source to a
  customer's data warehouse. Your data never hits our servers.
- **Eliminate pipeline complexity for customers and partners.** Customers can
  trust verified pipelines offered directly from your product. It takes minutes
  to activate customer-defined pipelines using a declarative configuration
  language.
- **Internalize revenue previously captured by third-party ETL providers.**
  Rather than contracting a third-party, customers pay you for higher-quality
  data, ease of use, and security enhancements.

### Get started for free

Deploy on your own infrastructure and keep control of your data.

##### [Click here to view our deployment guide.](/reference/quickstart)

Pipebird is designed to be self-hosted. Our platform can be launched within your
virtual cloud with the press of a button - your business data never hits our
servers. Furthermore, we perform networking and compute cost optimizations to
minimize your cloud provider bill.

[Pipebird Slack Community](https://join.slack.com/t/pipebirdcommunity/shared%5Finvite/zt-1emvmxdk6-jBc9qXDDgeLhinJ8ktOgHg)
or email [sales@pipebird.com](mailto:sales@pipebird.com) if you'd like help with
your deployment.

### Product features

#### Sources

Data originates from one of your company's sources, which can be any of:

- Postgres
- Redshift
- CockroachDB
- MySQL
- MariaDB
- etc.

#### Destinations

Your customers can define their own destinations, which your team can configure
through our Destinations API.

- Snowflake
- Amazon S3
- Amazon Redshift
- BigQuery \[in progress\]
- Databricks \[in progress\]
- CSV Export

### Data transformers

Customers can choose to define some set of transformations to be applied on data
by uploading Configurations which define mutations on the source data. For
example, a consumer may want the Date column updated_at to be casted into a
DateTime object in the destination.

We currently support renaming columns between sources and destinations and will
be expanding destinations and working on transformations like:

- casting data types
- sums
- averages
- sorts
- groupby
- etc.

### Our goal for Pipebird

We believe that creating a data pipeline should be made as simple as pressing a
button from a vendor's dashboard.

Native, customer-facing data pipelines offer a more secure and efficient way for
organizations to share data with one another. Companies like
[Stripe](https://stripe.com/data-pipeline) and
[Customer.io](https://customer.io/data-warehouse) have already invested in
building out native data sharing features for their customers. **Pipebird is
designed to help developers at any company quickly offer the same powerful data
sharing features, increasing security and decreasing complexity for their
customers.**

We'd love to work with you to grow Pipebird. Feel free to message us in the
[Pipebird Slack Community](https://join.slack.com/t/pipebirdcommunity/shared%5Finvite/zt-1emvmxdk6-jBc9qXDDgeLhinJ8ktOgHg).

### Open source vs. paid versions

The Pipebird repo is entirely [MIT licensed](/LICENSE), with the exception of
the `ee` directory (if applicable).

Premium features (contained in the `ee` directory) require a Pipebird license.
Contact us at [sales@pipebird.com](mailto:sales@pipebird.com) for more
information, or see our [pricing page](https://pipebird.com/pricing).

Pipebird is entirely free for developers. We'll make money by charging larger
companies that have more specific needs for additional features around security
and scale.
